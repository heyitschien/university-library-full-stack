# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to record significant technical decisions (new libraries, patterns, architecture shifts).

## How to write an ADR
- Copy `ADR-000-template.md` to a new file with the next sequence number.
- Name format: `ADR-<NNN>-<kebab-title>.md` (e.g., `ADR-001-imagekit-uploads.md`).
- Keep it short (1â€“2 pages max) and actionable.

## When to write an ADR
- Adding or replacing a core library (UI, forms, validation, data, uploads)
- Changing route or layout conventions
- Security/infra decisions (auth strategy, rate limiting, secrets handling)

## Index
- Maintain a list of ADRs here, newest first.
